# FROST: Planning with Learned Entity Prompts for Abstractive Summarization

We will release scripts to process summarization datasets to do FROST style
content planning and generation from our recently accepted
[TACL paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07606.pdf). We will also release our
models trained using the [Pegasus](https://github.com/google-research/pegasus)
framework and their predictions.
