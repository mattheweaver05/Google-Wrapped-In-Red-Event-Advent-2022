# Mostly Basic Python Problems Dataset

The benchmark consists of around 1,000 crowd-sourced Python programming problems, designed to be solvable by entry level programmers, covering programming fundamentals, standard library functionality, and so on. Each problem consists of a task description, code solution and 3 automated test cases.

As described in the paper, a subset of the data has been hand-verified by us. This data is `sanitized-mbpp.json`.

The dataset is in jasonl format.

Released as part of Program Synthesis with Large Language Models, Austin et. al., 2021.
